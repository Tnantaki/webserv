File Descriptor Acquisition: The open system call is used to open a file and obtain a file descriptor.
This file descriptor is an integer that identifies the open file.
Data Input/Output: To read data from or write data to the file, you use separate system calls like read and write.
These operations interact directly with the file descriptor, without the use of an internal buffer managed by the C library.
Unbuffered I/O: The I/O operations with open, read, and write
are considered unbuffered because they don't involve an intermediary buffer controlled
by the C library. Each read or write system call directly interacts with the file,
and there is no automatic buffering or batching of data.
